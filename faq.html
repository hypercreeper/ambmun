                <h2>What are Model United Nations conferences?</h2>
                <p>MUN is a simulation of the United Nations in the form of a weekend-long conference that puts students into scenarios
                that represent the organizations directly or indirectly linked to the United Nations. MUN conferences began as a
                student-led Model League of Nations back in the 1920's, and since the formation of the UN it has transformed into Model
                United Nations. The conference largely acts as an academic medium for high-schoolers to discuss and to have an
                understanding of global matters in a political, social and economic sense while also emphasizing and rewarding
                communication and networking skills.</p>
